		<p STYLE="font-size:20px;text-indent: 40px">My name is Collin Roberts. I am a freshman intended finance major at the University of Georgia. Although my major is finance, I have always had a passion for nature. This passion for nature has led me to make one major goal of life before I die: <B>to hike the Appalachian trail.</B> The Appalachian Trail is a 2,200 mile long marked hiking trail that passes through 14 states, starting in Georgia and ending in Maine.This trail was constructed in 1937 to be a weekend-getaway spot from busy cities for families. Since then, it has commonly been used by hikers who thru-hike from start to finish. </p>
		<p STYLE="font-size:20px;text-indent: 40px">I want to hike the entire Appalachian Trail for a few reasons. First, I want to experience the beauty and nature present along the trail. From lush forests full of wildlife to barren mountaintops, the trail is full of unmatched views. Second, I want to experience a life outside of the typical “Nine to Five” life. I know my future will probably consist of working eight hours a day, and I would like to live at some point of my life without a strict schedule. Last and most importantly, I want to hike the entire Appalachian Trail because I can. Most people feel they can’t do the things they want to because they “don’t have the time.” The way I see it, if I want to hike the Appalachian Trail and have the opportunity, it would be wrong not to.</p>
		<p STYLE="font-size:20px;text-indent: 4-px">Hiking the Appalachian Trail would likely take me six to seven months. I plan on starting the February after I graduate and ending in September. This means I would have to average around fifteen to twenty miles of hiking per day with the occasion rest day, also known on the trail as a “zero day.” Most of my zero days will take place in towns that I will pass through. Towns are usually around five days of hiking apart. When I pass through towns I will likely sleep in hostels rather than sleeping in shelters placed along the trail. This means I will plan on carrying six days of food with me at all times (one extra day for emergencies) and restock once I hit a town. One way of restocking is with mail drops where friends will send food in advance to a post office where I can pick it up. I will try to stay ultralight by packing little more than <a href="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/ten-essentials.html">the ten essentials</a>. With nothing more than what I can carry on my back, a determined mindset, and supportive friends, I will attempt a journey of a lifetime hiking the Appalachian Trail.</p>
