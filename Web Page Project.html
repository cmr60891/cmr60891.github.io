		<p STYLE="font-size:20px;text-indent: 40px">My name is Collin Roberts. I am a freshman intended finance major at the University of Georgia. Although my major is finance, I have always had a passion for nature. This passion for nature has led me to make one major goal of life before I die: <B>hiking the Appalachian trail.</B> The Appalachian Trail is a 2,200 mile long marked hiking trail that passes through 14 states, starting in Georgia and ending in Maine.This trail was constructed in 1937 to be a weekend-getaway spot from busy cities for families. Since then, it has commonly been used by hikers who thru-hike from start to finish. </p>
